			<span class="section-header">Get to know more about me</span>
			<p>In my sophmore year of high school, I took a web design course. With no knowledge whatsoever and little expectations, I entered a completely different world I had never thought I would come to love. In that class I coded for the first time, being introduced to HTML, CSS, and javascript. I even designed a website, for a competition between my classmates, that was chosen. Ever since that class, I knew I could do this forever, but then college happend and I heard so many mixed signals and strayed away from learning web design in an educational setting, but I never let my passion die.</p>
			<p>Here I am, today, finally getting my life on track and doing what I always wanted to do without being persuaded by anyone. This is what I love to do, and I am determined to enjoy my life while doing what I love!</p>

					<h1>VenturX</h1>
					<p>VenutrX was looking to revamp their entire UI to draw more users in as well as keep their existing users coming back. It was important to let new users understand what the company does so they are more engaged.</p>
					<p>As a front-end web developer, I was tasked with revamping their entire UI and expanded functionality of existing applications.</p>
